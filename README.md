# Moodesty

Moodesty is Java Android Application. I wanted to create app which contains all important feautres for people who are under pressure of stress. Not only for peaople with mental illness like depresion, but also for stressed and worn out.

At the moment, Moodesty is an underdeveloped application. However, I want to continue to develop it with further functionalities, to make it a fully mobile and functional application with a simple and intuitive interface.
